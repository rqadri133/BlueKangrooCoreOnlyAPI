# Veracode CLI Readme

The Veracode CLI provides access to Veracode capabilities from the command line, including Container Security.

## Pre-Requisites

Before using the Veracode CLI, you must configure your API credentials for Veracode. To do this, please do the following:

1. Ensure you have Veracode API credentials in the Veracode platform. To generate your credentials, please follow the instructions in our documentation: https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_api_credentials3
2. Configure your credentials for access by the Veracode CLI. You can do this in one of two ways:

- Run `./veracode configure` to create a Credentials file and follow the prompts.
- Create a credentials file in `$HOME/.veracode/credentials` using the instructions in our documentation: https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_configure_api_cred_file

Local documentation to use the CLI can be found by running `./veracode help`.
